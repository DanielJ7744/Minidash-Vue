        Confidential Information occurs or is threatened. In addition to any
        other remedies that may be available in law, in equity or otherwise, the
        disclosing party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent
        such unauthorised use or disclosure. Other Exceptions: Notwithstanding
        the foregoing provisions in this Section, the parties may disclose this
        Agreement: (i) as otherwise required by law or the rules of any stock
        exchange or over-the-counter trading system provided that reasonable
        measures are used to preserve the confidentiality of the Agreement; (ii)
        in confidence to legal counsel; (iii) in connection with the
        requirements of a public offering of securities filing provided
        reasonable measures are used to obtain confidential treatment for the
        proposed disclosure, to the extent such treatment is available; (iv) in
        connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any rights under
        this Agreement, provided that reasonable measures are used to preserve
        the confidentiality of the Agreement; (v) in confidence, to auditors,
        accountants and their advisors; and (vi) in confidence, in connection

        Affiliate of a party, provided that reasonable measures are used to
        preserve the confidentiality of the Agreement. For any legally compelled
        disclosure or disclosure pursuant to a court, regulatory, or securities
        filing, the parties shall reasonably cooperate to limit disclosure of
        this Agreement. For greater certainty, nothing in this Section 5 will
        diminish a receiving party's obligations under this Agreement to comply
        with applicable privacy and personal information protection laws.
